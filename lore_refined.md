The Shattered Isles: A World Forged in Cataclysm

The Shattered Isles are the fragmented remains of Eryndor, shattered millennia ago by the Cataclysm—a failed ritual by the Aetheric Conclave to bind the primal elements. This event disrupted the world's balance, scattering the land across the Azure Veil and birthing a reality where magic is both sustenance and peril.

The Four Dominions: Pillars of a Broken World

Each Dominion embodies one primal element, evolved from Eryndor's survivors over centuries of adaptation.





Embercrag Dominion: Volcanic realms of the Ashborne, ruled by Flameweavers communing with the dimming Eternal Pyre. Their hierarchical society prizes strength, but internal doubts grow as the flame wanes.



Verdant Spiral: Lush, living Isles of the Sylvar, guided by the Circle of Thorns and the withering Greenheart. Principled pacifists, they defend with nature's fury when provoked, often acting as reluctant mediators in wider conflicts.



Stormveil Expanse: Tempestuous skies of the Aerithians, led by shifting Windcallers. Nomadic innovators, their skyships facilitate essential trade, fostering tense interdependence amid growing storm chaos.



Abyssal Tides: Drowned depths of the Tidemarked, directed by Tideweavers interpreting oceanic whispers. Communal and secretive, they navigate darkening waters and stirring leviathans, wary of ties to emerging threats.

The Aetheric Veil: The Heart of the Shattered Isles

The Veil is the chaotic essence of the Cataclysm, sustaining the Isles while birthing Aetherborn—individuals with unstable magic. Emerging sporadically since the Cataclysm and increasing with the Unraveling, Aetherborn are outcasts whose powers reflect the world's fraying bonds.

The Echoes of Eryndor: Myths and Mysteries

Ruins and prophecies echo the past, hinting at a traitor's role in the Cataclysm. The "Fifth Element" (Aether) is now mythologized as a binder of the four, capable of restoration or ruin through harmony.

Cultural Nuances and Conflicts

Dominions clash over resources and ideologies but rely on fragile alliances and trade. Ashborne aggression meets Aerithian opportunism; Sylvar isolation contrasts Tidemarked secrecy. Yet, mutual needs—such as shared artifacts—prevent total war.

The Looming Threat: The Unraveling

Violent Veil fluctuations signal the Unraveling, with rifts spilling horrors. Tied to the lost Conclave keystone, it forces Dominions toward uneasy unity or destruction, embodying the core struggle for balance in a fractured world.
